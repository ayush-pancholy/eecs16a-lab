    "Recall from Touchscreen Lab 3A that most electronic systems perform 3 major tasks: (1) Sense, (2) Process, and (3) Actuate. We have already built the sensing block, where a touchpad is used to transduce physical quantities (i.e. touch) to electrical signals (i.e. voltage). In Lab 3A, we used a theoretical periodic square wave current source as the input to detect the change in capacitance. In this lab, we will instead use a periodic square wave voltage source instead of a periodic square wave current source. We will change the circuit to integrate the voltage signal instead of the current signal. Afterward, our previously implemented comparator circuit will digitize the integrated voltage. Finanlly, an LED will be used as the actuation block to transform the electrical signal (i.e. voltage) into physical quantities (i.e. light).\n",

However, our methodology of trying to integrate a square wave signal was on the right track - we just need to shift our focus to integrating a voltage source instead of a current source. The simple single capacitor circuit does not quite do the job, so we propose a new circuit topology discussed in lecture - the integrator circuit."

The function generator actually outputs a voltage peak to peak **2 times** higher than you set it (ex. if you set $5V_{ptp}$ the function generator will actually output $10V_{ptp}$). You can read more [here](https://www.keysight.com/main/editorial.jspx%3Fckey%3D1948055%26id%3D1948055%26nid%3D-11143.0.00%26lc%3Djpn%26cc%3DJP). According to the golden rules, the positive terminal of the op-amp is a virtual ground. Without the  $51\\Omega$ resistor, the loading of the function generator is  $10k\\Omega$, which is large enough to actually affect the output of the function generator. With the  $51\\Omega$  resistor in the circuit, the loading (effective resistance seen by the function generator) is approximately  $50\\Omega$, and the output won't be affected much by the loading effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about the $1M\\Omega$ resistor in the feedback loop? Imagine the circuit without the $1M\\Omega$ resistor in equilibrium - the capacitor is fully charged, so it acts as an open circuit, so there is no longer any negative feedback, so the OpAmp is in open loop operation, making it rail to $5V$ or $-5V$ depending on its inputs. The $1M\\Omega$ resistor creates a path for negative feedback (the same topology as the inverting amplifier) to maintain the negative feedback needed for the circuit to operate."

The function generator actually outputs a voltage peak to peak **2 times** higher than you set it (ex. if you set $5V_{ptp}$ the function generator will actually output $10V_{ptp}$). You can read more [here](https://www.keysight.com/main/editorial.jspx%3Fckey%3D1948055%26id%3D1948055%26nid%3D-11143.0.00%26lc%3Djpn%26cc%3DJP). According to the golden rules, the positive terminal of the op-amp is a virtual ground. Without the  $51\\Omega$ resistor, the loading of the function generator is  $10k\\Omega$, which is large enough to actually affect the output of the function generator. With the  $51\\Omega$  resistor in the circuit, the loading (effective resistance seen by the function generator) is approximately  $50\\Omega$, and the output won't be affected much by the loading effect.\n",

Imagine the circuit without the $1M\\Omega$ resistor in equilibrium - the capacitor is fully charged, so it acts as an open circuit, so there is no longer any negative feedback, so the OpAmp is in open loop operation, making it rail to $5V$ or $-5V$ depending on its inputs. The $1M\\Omega$ resistor creates a path for negative feedback (the same topology as the inverting amplifier) to maintain the negative feedback needed for the circuit to operate."

For this lab, you should be using breadboard wires for breadboard to breadboard connections, and cutting your wires short so that your breadboard is flush to the surface. Consider cutting your resistor legs short so that they are also flush with the breadboard. Debugging will be a nightmare if you leave everything looping above the breadboard - do this now before reading further.</span>**\n",

    "**<span style=\"color:red\">Part of the circuit has been translated for you as a starting point as shown in the image below. You should have the Op-Amp already plugged in along with a resistor and LED from the last section. You should have already used one of the Op-Amps in the dual Op-Amp chip in Task 3 - make sure to use the other Op-Amp that has not been used yet for the integrator, it is impossible to implement the entire circuit using only one of the Op-Amps (You do not need two chips on the board as one chip has two OpAmps in it, hence the Dual OpAmp IC). Please continue building the entire integrator circuit.</span>**\n",
